## ISDI Coders Bootcamp Final Project: Techno Playlist App

- Techno Playlist App

## Introduction

Welcome to the Techno Playlist App, the final project of the ISDI Coders bootcamp in Barcelona! This app is a CRUD application that allows techno music enthusiasts to create their own custom playlists, based on pre-defined playlists created by the developer.

Built with React and Redux Toolkit, this project provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to create, edit, delete, and update their playlists.

## Features

- User Login
  The Techno Playlist App requires users to login with their account in order to use the app. This feature helps to ensure that the user's playlists are kept private and secure.

## CRUD Functionality

The app provides full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their playlists with ease. Users can create new playlists from scratch, or use the pre-defined playlists created by the developer as a starting point.

Once a playlist has been created, users can add and remove tracks, change the order of tracks, and update the name and description of the playlist. If a user wants to delete a playlist, they can do so with just a click of a button.

# Pre-Defined Playlists

The developer has created a number of pre-defined playlists to help users get started. These playlists feature a variety of techno music genres, including techno house, techno trance, and techno minimal. Users can use these playlists as a starting point and customize them to their liking, or create their own playlists from scratch.

# Responsive Design (soon)

The Techno Playlist App will be designed to be fully responsive, so users can access it on any device and enjoy their favorite techno tracks wherever they are. The app's interface will adjusts to fit the screen size of the device being used, ensuring that the user always has a seamless and enjoyable experience.
